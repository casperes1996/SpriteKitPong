# SpriteKitPong

A simple little SpriteKit version of Pong written for the Mac in a few horus just for fun :)

Space bar starts the round, w and s move the left paddle while up and down arrows move the right, intended for local multiplayer as just a bit of fun

Speed of ball and paddles can be configured in code. Paddle speed is the variable in the Paddle file, and ball speed is the multiplier for dx and dy in startGame. 

.app bundle is signed just for local execution
